### Prerequisites

Before you need install follow tools in your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container).
Beyond is good to has an editor for to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# 1. Overview

This application is a demonstration how to implement a signin in react.js using several libraries and technologies.

## 1.1. Stack

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/.docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) >= v18.17.1
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)
- [React.js](https://react.dev/)

## 1.2. Auxiliary libs

- [MUI](https://mui.com/)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)
- [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [React-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)

# 2. 🔬 How To Run

## 2.1. Containers

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/LucasJunio/signin-react

# Acces the project folder in your terminal/cmd
$ cd signin-react

# Build the image/container docker with Hot reloading / live reloading in development
$ docker-compose up -d --build

```

The aplication going to open in port:3000 - access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 2.1.1 How to add a new library in containers

Add a new library inside your container running live reload it's very symple, need just two steps:

First:

Add your libraries and versions (preference LTS) inside the package.json

Second:

At the very least you need to stop the current container from the application, to release used port

```bash

# (Optional) Delete your container and image docker for optimization
$ docker stop container_name_to_exclude
$ docker rm container_name_to_exclude
$ docker rmi IMAGE_NAME_OR_ID

# (Optional) Or just delete all containers and images
$ docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
$ docker rmi $(docker images -q)

# (Mandatory) Build the image/container docker with Hot reloading / live reloading in development
$ docker-compose up -d --build

```

-

Result:

## 2.2. Local

Run the development server local with &quot;yarn&quot;, &quot;npm&quot;, &quot;pnpm&quot; or manager package your preference:

```bash

# Install dependencies
$ yarn install

# Run the project
$ yarn dev

```

The aplication going to open in port:3000 - access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

# 3. How to create a new branch

Ever that's necessary to create a new branch feature, create by [main]branch, implement your development, merge this feature/branch to develop, when all it's ok, give a merge of this feature/branch to main[branch].

Let's go to follow the git flow patterns to create a new branch, to more info browse in link below to learn more how to implement in simple way.

Workflow gitflow: https://www.atlassian.com/br/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow

```bash

# Example creating a new branch
$ git checkout -b feature/TASK-1

```

## 3.1. Commits

For commit your changes, you can follow the suggestion to use conventional commits [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/] for to improve your commit descriptions and help the understand of the team. Exist a extension in vscode that can help you with this mission.

vscode extension id in .vscode/extensions.json:

"recommendations": ["vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits"]

# 4. Software Architecture

Main folder tree and your goals

C:.

- ├───public
- └───src
  - ├───assets
  - ├───components - This is where you would put your reusable React components.
  - ├───containers - Components that combine smaller components to create more complex UI elements or pages.
  - │ ├───Dashboard
  - │ ├───NotFound
  - │ └───Signin
  - ├───routes
  - ├───services
  - └───store - This folder could house the state management.

# 5. Recommended Extensions

You can check out a list of recommended extensions in the file `.vscode/extensions.json`, or by opening the "Extensions" Tab in the "Recommended" pane.
